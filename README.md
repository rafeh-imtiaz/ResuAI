Voice interview agent and CV shortlisting system using LLMs (LLaMA via Ollama), Whisper, and TTS

# 🧠 ResuAI – AI-Powered CV Screening & Voice Interview Agent

ResuAI is an AI-driven toolkit to automate the recruitment process. It consists of two powerful Streamlit apps:

1. **Enhanced Resume Screening** (`enhanced_resu_ai.py`) – Upload CVs and a job description to automatically score and shortlist candidates using a local LLM (LLaMA via Ollama).
2. **Voice Interview Agent** (`voice_agent.py`) – Conduct voice-based interviews with shortlisted candidates, validate their answers using AI, and generate an automated evaluation.
